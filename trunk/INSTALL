Charm-Crypto: Installation Documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Charm has done a great job at automating the installation process such that the end-user
does not have to directly handle dependencies, linking, compiler flag setting, and the
like.  However, there is always the corner case in which an end-user is using a currently
unsupported platform, and thus may need to build and install using a very manual process.

We would like to support you in this case, and have written this documentation to get 
you started on your path using Charm.  This installation file will contain some n
installation blocks highlighting each respective implementation.  

Before we begin, please note the current dependencies:
    
	Python3 or Python2.7
	Pyparsing http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/
    GMP http://www.swox.com/gmp/
    PBC http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/news.html 
    OPENSSL http://www.openssl.org/

	See ./configure --help for other options.
	
	
BUILDING IN LINUX
------------------------

Note that the entire compilation process is supported by the Charm configure/make scripts.
The steps for building in linux this way are:
	1. In a terminal, run configure.sh
	2. The process will fail out at wget, and will ask you to install.
	3. Using your package manager of choice (e.g., sudo apt-get install wget), install wget.
    4. With wget installed, run the configure.sh script again, and it should set up your
       Make dependencies for you.  
    5. Make build.
    6. Make install.	
    *. Another way to install dependencies is to use your package manager of choice.
	
[Debian / Crunchbang / Ubuntu / Mint]

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

1. Before installing Charm, there are a few prerequisites that need to be installed on your system. These are:
	1. Subversion
		sudo apt-get install subversion
	2. Python 3 (By default, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS comes with 2.6 and does not officially support 2.7. Charm requires 2.7 or 3.x) and header files/static library
		sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev
	3. m4
		sudo apt-get install m4
	4. libssl-dev
		sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

2. Now we need to obtain a copy of Charm:
	svn checkout http://charm-crypto.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ charm-crypto-read-only

3. Next, we will install Charm. Navigate to the Charm directory.
	1. We must first run the configuration script:
		sudo ./configure.sh –python=/path/to/python3
	2. Now we will build and install Charm:
		sudo make build
		sudo make install
	3. And finally we must rebuild the searchpath for libraries
		sudo ldconfig

Ubuntu 11.04

1. Before installing Charm, there are a few prerequisites that need to be installed on your system. These are:
	1. Subversion
		sudo apt-get install subversion
	2. m4
		sudo apt-get install m4
	3. Python 3 (this is an optional, though recommended, step)
		sudo apt-get install python3
	4. Header files/static library
		sudo apt-get install python-dev (if you did not install Python 3)
		sudo apt-get install python3-dev (if you did install Python 3)
	5. libssl-dev (only necessary if you did not install Python 3)
		sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

2. Now we need to obtain a copy of Charm:
	svn checkout http://charm-crypto.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ charm-crypto-read-only

3. Next, we will install Charm. Navigate to the Charm directory.
	1. We must first run the configuration script:
		sudo ./configure.sh
		[If you installed Python 3 and would like to use that, you will need to add –python=/path/to/python3]
	2. Now we will build and install Charm:
		sudo make build
		sudo make install
	3. And finally we must rebuild the searchpath for libraries
		sudo ldconfig

[Fedora] 

1. Before installing Charm, there are a few prerequisites that need to be installed on your system. These are:
	1. m4
		su -c "yum install m4"
	3. Python 3 (this is an optional, though recommended, step)
		su -c "yum install python3"
	4. Header files/static library
		su -c "yum install python-devel" (if you did not install Python 3)
		su -c "yum install python3-devel" (if you did install Python 3)
	5. openssl-devel (only necessary if you did not install Python 3)
		su -c "yum install openssl-devel"

2. Red Hat/Fedora has decided not to support ECC in OpenSSL due to patent concerns, so we now need to remove their restriction and manually import the required files.
	1. Remove the ECC restriction
		1. Navigate to /usr/include/openssl
			cd /usr/include/openssl
		2. Open the OpenSSL configuration file for editing using your editor of choice
			su -c "vi opensslconf-i386.h"
		3. Remove the flags that restrict the use of ECC
			Delete (at the beginning of file)
				#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_EC
				# define OPENSSL_NO_EC
				#endif
				#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_ECDH
				# define OPENSSL_NO_ECDH
				#endif
				#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_ECDSA
				# define OPENSSL_NO_ECDSA
				#endif
			Delete (later on the file)
				# if defined(OPENSSL_NO_EC) && !defined(NO_EC)
				#  define NO_EC
				# endif
				# if defined(OPENSSL_NO_ECDH) && !defined(NO_ECDH)
				#  define NO_ECDH
				# endif
				# if defined(OPENSSL_NO_ECDSA) && !defined(NO_ECDSA)
				#  define NO_ECDSA
				# endif
		4. Save the file and close it
	2. Add the ECC files
		1. Navigate to http://www.openssl.org/source/ and download the latest version of openssl source
		2. Untar it
		3. Navigate to /path/to/openssl-[version]/include/openssl (ie inside the untarred file)
			cd /path/to/openssl-[version]/include/openssl
		4. Add the new files to the current OpenSSL installation
			su -c "yes n | cp * /usr/include/openssl"

3. Now we need to obtain a copy of Charm:
	svn checkout http://charm-crypto.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ charm-crypto-read-only

4. Next, we will install Charm. Navigate to the Charm directory.
	1. We must first run the configuration script:
		su -c "./configure.sh"
		[If you installed Python 3 and would like to use that, you will need to add –python=/path/to/python3]
	2. Now we will build and install Charm:
		su -c "make build"
		su -c "make install"
	3. And finally we must rebuild the searchpath for libraries
		su -c "ldconfig"

BUILDING IN WINDOWS
------------------------

Note that the entire compilation process is now supported by the Charm configure/make scripts.
The steps for building in mingw32 this way are:
    1. Download the latest source version of openssl.
	2. Run MinGW Shell.
    3. Extract openssl, configure and install as shown below.	
	4. Extract Charm, and navigate to the top directory.
	5. Run configure.sh as shown below.
	6. The process will fail out at wget, and open Internet Explorer to the wget download 
	   page.
	7. Install wget, and set it's bin directory on your PATH.  To do this, right-click My 
	   Computer, Select Properties, Select Advanced System Settings, Select Advanced, Select
       Environment Variables, and than PATH.  Scroll to the end, and enter a ; followed by 
       the absolute path to the bin directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\etc).
    8. With wget installed, run the configure.sh script again, and it should set up your
       Make dependencies for you.  
    9. Make build.
   10. Make install.
    *. Another way to install dependencies is to follow the Windows blocks below.	

[MinGW32]

Let's first build our dependencies with the following scripts:
	
	#GMP
	./configure --prefix=/mingw --disable-static --enable-shared
	make
	make install
	
	#OPENSSL
	./config --openssldir=/mingw --shared # This gets us around installing perl.
	make
	make install

	#PBC
	./configure --prefix=/mingw --disable-static --enable-shared
	make
	make install
	
	#Building Charm
	./configure --prefix=/mingw --python=/c/Python32/python.exe

BUILDING IN OS X 
------------------------

Note that the entire compilation process is supported by the Charm configure/make scripts.
The steps for building in os x this way are:
	1. In a terminal, run configure.sh
	2. The process will fail out at wget, and will ask you to install.
	3. Using your package manager of choice (e.g., sudo port install wget), install wget.
    4. With wget installed, run the configure.sh script again, and it should set up your
       Make dependencies for you.  
    5. Make build.
    6. Make install.	
    *. Another way to install dependencies is to use macports or fink.
